## Project Overview

Welcome to our E-commerce Book Store! This README provides an overview of our approach and the tech stack used to build this web application.

### Project Description

Our E-commerce Book Store is designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly platform for users to browse and purchase books online. The application offers the following key features:

1. **Home Page**:

   - Divided into three main sections: Featured Books, Discounted Books, and Explore Books.
   - All book listings are dynamic and fetch data from our database in real-time.

2. **Discounted Books**:

   - Displays both the discounted price and the original sale price for books on sale.

3. **Skeleton Loading State**:

   - Implemented for the Explore Books section to enhance user experience while data is loading.

4. **Sorting**:

   - Users can sort the book listings by price low to high, price high to low, and ratings to find books that match their preferences.

5. **Book Details**:

   - When users click on a book, they can view the Book Summary, Add to Cart button, and a section displaying Recommended Books based on their selection.

6. **Shopping Cart**:
   - Allows users to view and manage the books they have added to their cart.
   - Users can increase or decrease the quantity of books and remove items from the cart.
   - Displays Subtotal, Tax, and Total for the items in the cart.

### Tech Stack

We used the following technologies and tools to develop our E-commerce Book Store:

- **React**: We chose React for building the user interface due to its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, which makes it ideal for dynamic web applications.

- **React Router**: To manage navigation within the application and ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.

- **Webpack**: Used for bundling and managing project assets, enabling efficient code splitting and optimization.

- **Babel**: Transpiles modern JavaScript code into browser-compatible code, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
